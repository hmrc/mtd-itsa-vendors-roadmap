# HMRC online services

A new Income Tax Self Assessment service for customers and their authorised agents to update and submit an income tax return is being made available in HMRC online services.

Customers in MTD will use this service to report income that is not supported in their software.

* Customers will *not* be able to use this service to send updates for business and property income with quarterly filing obligations.
* Non-MTD customers who are not using software will use this service to file their self assessment tax return once their record has migrated to the new service.

**Usable in year**

<a name="def_uiy"></a>

This means that the functionality is available during the active tax year to report against. 
For example, transitional profit can be reported during the active tax year.

If "Usable in year?" is "No", the functionality is not available until after the tax year has ended. 
For example, High Income Child Benefit liability cannot be reported until after the tax year has ended.
