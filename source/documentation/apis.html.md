**Breaking changes**

If "Breaking?" is "Yes", the change will break software which relies on the API, and will therefore be introduced in a new API version. 

If "Breaking?" is "No", the change will not break existing software and does not require the API version to be incremented. 

For more details, see the section on [breaking changes](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/guides/income-tax-mtd-end-to-end-service-guide/documentation/how-to-integrate.html#breaking-changes) in the service guide.

**Affects quarterly updates**

This means that the change directly impacts MTD mandated customers and their submissions of periodic updates.

**Usable in year**

<a name="def_uiy"></a>

This means that the functionality is available during the active tax year to report against. 
For example, transitional profit can be reported during the active tax year.

If "Usable in year?" is "No", the functionality is not available until after the tax year has ended. 
For example, High Income Child Benefit liability cannot be reported until after the tax year has ended.
