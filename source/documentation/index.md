# Income Tax (Making Tax Digital) roadmap 

Last updated: 11 April 2024

## About this roadmap

This roadmap sets out our anticipated schedule for future releases for Income Tax (Making Tax Digital) APIs. It also provides details of releases relating to
the service delivered via other mechanisms, such as a user interface.

**What is a front end API?**

A front end API is an API that will allow integration of various API endpoints into your software.

**What can it do?**

In the 'sandbox' it will allow you to test the experience a customer would have using this functionality by sending back
test responses that mimic the real customer environment. It will not work for real customers until the API is in
production and HMRC back end functionality is available.

**What is the back end functionality?**

This is the functionality developed in HMRC which allows API endpoints to be integrated into your software to call a
customer's information (or update a customer's record) required to complete certain transactions. This could include verifying a customer's details, in which case a request would be sent to HMRC and our back end
functionality would check whether the customer information is correct. This would also be the way customers would send
HMRC their updates, through the frontend API in your software, to the back end function in HMRC which would update their
record.

**When will the back end functionality be available?**

The back end functionality is being developed in parallel with the front end APIs and their end points. We show on
this roadmap when front end APIs will be available in sandbox or production that can connect to back end
functionality.

**What is controlled go-live?**

Before releasing functionality to all our customers we will conduct testing with limited customers. This period is
referred to as 'controlled go-live' or private beta.

We would welcome your feedback to improve our roadmap further.
