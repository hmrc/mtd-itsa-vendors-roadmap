# Making Tax Digital for Income Tax roadmap 

Last updated: 15 September 2025 (see [changelog](#document-changelog))

## About this roadmap

This roadmap sets out our anticipated schedule for future releases for Making Tax Digital for Income Tax APIs. It also provides details of releases relating to the service delivered via other mechanisms, such as HMRC online services.

New features are first released into the Sandbox, which enables you to test the experience a customer would have and sends back example responses. New features do not work for real customers until the change is in Production.
